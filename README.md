3. **Added TrueMoney as a Payment Option by Using Extend**  
   This extension allows users to select TrueMoney for payments, providing a secure and convenient payment method. It enhances the platform’s flexibility by offering an alternative payment option for users who prefer using TrueMoney.

4. **Added Credit Card as a Payment Option by Using Extend**  
   This extension allows users to make payments via credit card, offering a secure and widely-accepted payment method. It enhances the platform’s flexibility by providing an additional convenient payment option for users who prefer to use credit cards.
